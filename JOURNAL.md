June 26th

I started my project and the github repo. Also started reading the guidelines from Highway for the projects. So here's my first entry.

I've set up SOME basic elements for the schematic although it looks pretty sparse and messy.

Still need:
- Esp32
- Speaker
- Aux port for some recoding capability (This is not prioritised)
- Joystick/Rotary Dial for key changes
- And some buttons (Might use cherry MX or some substitute)

I'll ask slack tomorrow about these things, also make some kind of layout for visuals.

Feeling tired, will make a pr to the Highway Github and then do other things.
